/// <summary>
///  Etp Leverage Factor: Tracks the integral relationship of the ETP to the underlying index.   Example: If the underlying Index increases by a value of 1 and the ETPâ€™s Leverage factor is 3, indicates the ETF will increase/decrease (see Inverse) by 3. Note: Leverage Factor of 1 indicates the ETP is NOT leveraged. This field is used for LULD Tier I price band calculation purposes.
