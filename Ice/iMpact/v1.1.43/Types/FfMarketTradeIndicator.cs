    ///  Ff Market Trade Indicator: Legacy field that supports all single character trade types on ICE. The new 3-character “OffMarketTradeType” field replaces this field. In the future (no earlier than 2015), ICE anticipates the introduction of 3 character trade types that will only be available in the new field. Trade types that are longer than a single character will be represented with “#” in this field.  Only for off market trade. The first character is ‘ ‘ when it is a regular trade.
